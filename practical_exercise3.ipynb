The distance is measured in miles, mass is measured in pounds, and the temperature is measured in Fahrenheit. She is having trouble converting these values into metric units. Another problem is that she cannot remember the conversion ratios. Luckily, she has you as a friend. In this practical exercise, you will write a number of functions to help your friend in converting these values. \n"
